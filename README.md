# Goldenhorse Screening Bookmarker
This is a Chrome extension designed to assist cinephiles in purchasing movie tickets for the Goldenhorse Film Festival. It highlights the ticket website (https://tghff.tixcraft.com/activity), helping users avoid selecting the wrong screening time during busy periods when tickets are quickly sold out. By bookmarking your screening choice, the extension automatically highlights the corresponding entry on the ticket website.
